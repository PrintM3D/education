# CAD

Subject Area: Engineering

Learning Objectives: Students will learn about the principles of CAD. 

Materials Needed: One computer, CAD software, one Micro or Micro+ 3D printer, at least one 1,000ft spool of 3D Ink \(ABS-R recommended\), and one 250ft spool of Tough 3D Ink to print the wheels per student or small groups of students. 

Brief Description: Students will design and print all the components of a truck, including: the frame, wheels, axles, hubs, cab and bed. 

To Prepare: Students will need a computer that has the M3D software on it. We recommend one printer per every 2-5 students. The Micro or Micro+ 3D printer will need to be plugged into both the wall and the computer. Each printer will need to have a spool of 3D Ink feeding into the external port. A spool holder is also recommended. 

If you need assistance with any of the above please see our guides at support.printm3d.com. 

Lesson Plan: 

1. Either individually or in small groups, ask students to design the different components of a truck. They will need to design a frame, the wheels, axles, hubs, a cab and a bed.   
2. Students should print the different parts of their truck. We recommend printing the wheels in Tough 3D Ink and the rest in ABS-R.   
3. Students can assemble their trucks after each part has completed printing. If the parts donâ€™t fit together properly, they will need to adjust their design.
