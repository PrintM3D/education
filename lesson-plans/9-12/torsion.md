# Torsion

Subject Area: Engineering

Learning Objectives: Students will learn about the torsion of different types of materials. 

Materials Needed: One computer, one Micro or Micro+ 3D printer, at least three spools of 3D Ink in different materials and weights per 2-5 students. 

Brief Description: Students will print out test models in different materials and measure their torsion. 

To Prepare: Students will need a computer that has the M3D software on it. We recommend one printer per every 2-5 students. The Micro or Micro+ 3D printer will need to be plugged into both the wall and the computer. Each printer will need to have a spool of 3D Ink feeding into the external port. A spool holder is also recommended. 

If you need assistance with any of the above please see our guides at support.printm3d.com. 

Lesson Plan: 

1. Divide students into small groups.   
2. Students will go online to https://support.printm3d.com/145216-3D-Models and download the torsion test models.   
3. Each group should print one torsion model in at least three different types of materials.   
4. Once they have their models printed, students should add weight to one side and measure how much weight it takes to rotate the model 1, 2 & 3mm.
