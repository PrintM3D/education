# Dissect A Frog

Subject Area: Science

Learning Objectives: Students will learn about the anatomy of a frog 

Materials Needed: One computer, one Micro or Micro+ 3D printer, and at least one 250ft 3D Ink filament spool per 2-5 students. 

Brief Description: Students will print out models of a frog, assemble it, and then dissect the frog. 

To Prepare: Students will need a computer that has the M3D software on it. We recommend one printer per every 2-5 students. The Micro or Micro+ 3D printer will need to be plugged into both the wall and the computer. Each printer will need to have a spool of 3D Ink feeding into the external port. A spool holder is also recommended. 

If you need assistance with any of the above please see our guides at support.printm3d.com. 

Lesson Plan: 

1. Students will go online to: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:258112 and download the models as well as the pdf of the instructions.   
2. Students will print all of the models.  
3. After they have printed all the models, students should assemble the organs into the frog following the instructions in the pdf.  
4. Once they have assembled their frogs, they can dissect their frogs and identify the different organs.   
5. Students can then write up a dissection report referencing the 3d printed organs they dissected.
