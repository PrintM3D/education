# Fabrication

Subject Area: Engineering

Learning Objectives: Students will learn about the principles of CAD. 

Materials Needed: One computer, CAD software, one Micro or Micro+ 3D printer, and one 1,000ft spool of 3D Ink per 2-5 students. 

Brief Description: Students will print out an assembly that does not fit together. Students will examine the assembly to determine what to fix, change the part dimensions in CAD and reprint the parts until they have a working assembly. They will then write up their changes. 

To Prepare: Students will need a computer that has the M3D software on it. We recommend one printer per every 2-5 students. The Micro or Micro+ 3D printer will need to be plugged into both the wall and the computer. Each printer will need to have a spool of 3D Ink feeding into the external port. A spool holder is also recommended. 

If you need assistance with any of the above please see our guides at support.printm3d.com. 

Lesson Plan: 

1. Either individually or in small groups, students will go online to https://support.printm3d.com/145216-3D-Models, download and print the assembly models. Students should also download the CAD file.   
2. Students will need to examine to assembly to determine what to fix.   
3. Students will change the part dimensions in CAD and reprint until they have a working assembly. Students should write up the changes they made.
