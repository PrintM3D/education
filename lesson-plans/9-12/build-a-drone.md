# Build A Drone

Subject Area: Technology

Learning Objectives: Students will learn about the mechanics of a drone and how to code a drone. 

Materials Needed: One computer, one Micro or Micro+ 3D printer, motors, wires, and at least one 1000ft 3D Ink filament spool \(ABS-R is recommended\) per 2-5 students. 

Brief Description: Students will print and assemble a drone, add motors and wires, and then code the drone. 

To Prepare: Students will need a computer that has the M3D software on it. We recommend one printer per every 2-5 students. The Micro or Micro+ 3D printer will need to be plugged into both the wall and the computer. Each printer will need to have a spool of 3D Ink feeding into the external port. A spool holder is also recommended. 

If you need assistance with any of the above please see our guides at support.printm3d.com. 

Lesson Plan: 

1. Divide students into small groups.   
2. Students will go online to thingiverse and find models of a quad rotor robot \(drone\). Here is an example: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:267008  
3. Each group should print out and assemble one drone. The group will need to add a motor and wires to make the drone fly.   
4. Each group will need to code their drone.   
5. After the robots are complete, the groups can compete their robots against each other.
