# Self Portrait

Subject Area: Art

Learning Objectives: Students will learn about creating 3D self-portraits. 

Materials Needed: One computer, modeling software, one Micro or Micro+ 3D printer, and at least one 250ft spool of 3D Ink per 2-5 students.

Brief Description: Students will model themselves in 3D, print their models and paint them in high detail. 

To Prepare: Students will need a computer that has the M3D software on it. We recommend one printer per every 2-5 students. The Micro or Micro+ 3D printer will need to be plugged into both the wall and the computer. Each printer will need to have a spool of 3D Ink feeding into the external port. A spool holder is also recommended. 

If you need assistance with any of the above please see our guides at support.printm3d.com. 

Lesson Plan: 

1. Students will use modeling software to create a 3D model of their face.  
2. Students will then print out their models.  
3. Students should realistically paint their models in high detail.
