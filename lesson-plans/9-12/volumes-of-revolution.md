# Volumes Of Revolution

Subject Area: Math

Learning Objectives: Students will learn the volumes of revolution.

Materials Needed: One computer, one Micro or Micro+ 3D printer, at least three spools of 3D Ink in different materials and weights per 2-5 students.

Brief Description: Students will print out visual aids they can use while learning about the volumes of revolution. 

To Prepare: Students will need a computer that has the M3D software on it. We recommend one printer per every 2-5 students. The Micro or Micro+ 3D printer will need to be plugged into both the wall and the computer. Each printer will need to have a spool of 3D Ink feeding into the external port. A spool holder is also recommended.
