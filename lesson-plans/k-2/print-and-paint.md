# Print & Paint



**Subject Area: Art**

Learning Objectives: Students will be able to print and then paint a 3D model.

Materials Needed: One computer, one Micro or Micro+ 3D printer and one 250ft clear PLA 3D Ink filament spool per 2-5 students, paint \(acrylic is recommended\) and paint brushes.

Brief Description: Students will learn how to print a 3D model and then paint their creation to turn it into a work of art.

To Prepare: Students will need a computer that has the M3D software on it. We recommend one printer per every 2-5 students. The Micro or Micro+ 3D printer will need to be plugged into both the wall and the computer. Each printer will need to have a clear 250ft spool of PLA 3D Ink feeding into the external port. A spool holder is also recommended to hold the filament as it feeds into the printer.

Lesson Plan:

1. Students will go online to: [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:918/\#files](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:918/#files) and download the two teapot model files.
2. Students will open the M3D Software on a computer, and upload the model. Once uploaded, they will click print. You will need to repeat this step with both the teapot model and the teapot lid model.
3. After the model has completed printing, remove it from the print bed. Now, it is ready to paint!
4. Students can decorate their teapot any way they like. Acrylic paint is recommended.
