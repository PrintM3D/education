# Big Numbers



**Subject Area: Math**

Learning Objectives: Students will be able to count from 0-9 in order.

Materials Needed: One computer, one Micro or Micro+ 3D printer, and one 250ft PLA 3D Ink filament spool per 2-5 students.

Brief Description: Students will learn how to count from 0-9 in order using 3d printed numbers which grow in physical size as the number gets bigger.

To Prepare: Students will need a computer that has the M3D software on it. We recommend one printer per every 2-5 students. The Micro or Micro+ 3D printer will need to be plugged into both the wall and the computer. Each printer will need to have a 250ft spool of PLA feeding into the external port. A spool holder is also recommended.

Lesson Plan:

1. Students will go online to: https://support.printm3d.com/145216-3D-Models and download the number models: 0-9.
2. Students will open the M3D Software on a computer, and upload the zero model. Help students scale this model to about 25mm in size and click print.
3. Repeat with the other number models, asking students to print each number bigger than the last one.
4. Students now have a visual representation of the numbers which should grow in size from 0-9 that they can use to practice counting.
