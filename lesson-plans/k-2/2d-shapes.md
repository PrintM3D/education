# 2D Shapes

**Subject Area: Math**

Learning Objectives: Students will be able to identify circles, squares, triangles, and rectangles.

Materials Needed: One computer, one Micro or Micro+ 3D printer, and one 250ft PLA 3D Ink filament spool per 2-5 students. 

Brief Description: Students will learn about 2D shapes with visual 3D printed tools. 

To Prepare: Students will need a computer that has the M3D software on it. We recommend one printer per every 2-5 students. The Micro or Micro+ 3D printer will need to be plugged into both the wall and the computer. Each printer will need to have a 250ft spool of PLA feeding into the external port. A spool holder is also recommended to hold the filament as it feeds into the printer.

Lesson Plan: 

1. Students will go online to: https://support.printm3d.com/145216-3D-Models and download the 4 shape models: Circle, Triangle, Rectangle, and Square. 

2. Students will open the M3D Software on a computer, and upload one of the 4 models. Once uploaded, they will click print. 

3. After the model has completed printing, remove it from the print bed. 

4. Repeat steps 1-3 with each of the other shape models. 

5. Students now have a visual representation of each shape. Discuss the properties of each shape, and ask the students to identify the shapes.
