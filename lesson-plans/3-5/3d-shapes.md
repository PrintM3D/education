# 3D Shapes

Subject Area: Math

Students print 3D shapes with the name of the shape on them

Learning Objectives: Students will be able to identify the following shapes: trapezoid, paralellogram, rhombus, hexagon, cylinder, rectangular prism and pyramid. 

Materials Needed: One computer, one Micro or Micro+ 3D printer, and one 250ft PLA 3D Ink filament spool per 2-5 students. 

Brief Description:  Students will learn about 3D shapes with visual 3D printed tools. 

To Prepare: Students will need a computer that has the M3D software on it. We recommend one printer per every 2-5 students. The Micro or Micro+ 3D printer will need to be plugged into both the wall and the computer. Each printer will need to have a 250ft spool of PLA feeding into the external port. A spool holder is also recommended.

Lesson Plan: 

1. Students will go online to: https://support.printm3d.com/067211-3D-Shapes and download the 7 shape models: trapezoid, paralellogram, rhombus, hexagon, cylinder, rectangular prism and pyramid. 

2. Students will open the M3D Software on a computer, and upload one of the 7 models. Once uploaded, they will click print. After the model has completed printing, carefully remove it from the print bed. 

3. Repeat steps 1-3 with each of the other shape models. 

4. Students now have a visual representation of each shape. Discuss the properties of each shape, and ask the students to identify the shapes.
