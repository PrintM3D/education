# Print Leaves

Subject Area: Science

Learning Objectives: Students will learn how to identify 4 different kinds of leaves: oak, elm, maple, and horse chestnut. 

Materials Needed: One computer, one Micro or Micro+ 3D printer, and one 250ft PLA 3D Ink filament spool per 2-5 students. 

Brief Description: Students will print and identify aspects of four different types of leaves. 

To Prepare: Students will need a computer that has the M3D software on it. We recommend one printer per every 2-5 students. The Micro or Micro+ 3D printer will need to be plugged into both the wall and the computer. Each printer will need to have a 250ft spool of PLA feeding into the external port. A spool holder is also recommended. 

If you need assistance with any of the above please see our guides at support.printm3d.com. 

Lesson Plan: 

1. Students will go online to: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:480251/\#files and download the four leaf files: oak.stl, elm.stl, maple.stl, and horse\_chestnut.stl. 

2. Open the M3D software on the computer and upload the model. Scale the model to the desired size and click print.

3. Once the leaves have finished printing, ask students to identify and write down different aspects of the leaves.
