# Paint A Puzzle

Subject Area: Art

Learning Objectives: Students will learn basic painting techniques.   
   
Materials Needed: One computer, one Micro or Micro+ 3D printer, and one 250ft 3D Ink filament spool \(PLA or ABS-R3 recommended\) per 2-5 students, paint \(acrylic works best\) and paintbrushes. 

Brief Description: Students will print, assemble, and then paint their own unique puzzle. 

To Prepare: Students will need a computer that has the M3D software on it. We recommend one printer per every 2-5 students. The Micro or Micro+ 3D printer will need to be plugged into both the wall and the computer. Each printer will need to have a 250ft spool feeding into the external port. A spool holder is also recommended. 

If you need assistance with any of the above please see our guides at support.printm3d.com. 

Lesson Plan: 

1. Students will go online to https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:890639 and download the puzzle models. 

2. Students will upload the models to M3D software and click print. You will not need to use any supports. 

3. Once the models have printed, students should assemble their puzzles and paint a design on them.
