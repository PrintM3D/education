# Print & Assemble A Plane

Grade Level: 3 - 5

Subject Area: Technology, Engineering

Learning Objectives: Students will be able to find a 3D model of an airplane online, upload it to 3D printing software, and print the model. They will then assemble the model into a plane. 

Materials Needed: One computer, one Micro or Micro+ 3D printer, and one 250ft PLA 3D Ink filament spool per 2-5 students. 

Brief Description: Students will learn how to find a 3D model of an airplane online, upload it to 3D printing software, and print a 3D model. 

To Prepare: Students will need a computer that has the M3D software on it. We recommend one printer per every 2-5 students. The Micro or Micro+ 3D printer will need to be plugged into both the wall and the computer. Each printer will need to have a 250ft spool of PLA feeding into the external port. A spool holder is also recommended. 

If you need assistance with any of the above please see our guides at support.printm3d.com. 

Lesson Plan: 

1. Students will go online to: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:768527 and download the model. 

2. Open the M3D software on the computer and upload the model. Scale it to the desired size and click print. 

3. Once the print has completed, remove it from the print bed. Students will then need to remove the various pieces of the plane and snap them together to assemble the plane. Be sure to put the wheels in place first, before bending them down. Students now have a 3D printed airplane they can take home.
