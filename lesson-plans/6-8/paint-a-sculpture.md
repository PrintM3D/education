# Paint A Sculpture

Subject Area: Art

Learning Objectives: Students will print and paint a bust of one of three different historical icons: Albert Einstein, Abraham Lincoln, or Ludwig Beethoven. 

Materials Needed: One computer, one Micro or Micro+ 3D printer, and one 250ft PLA 3D Ink filament spool per 2-5 students, paint \(acrylic is recommended\) and paint brushes. 

Brief Description:  Students will print and paint a bust of one of three different historical icons: Albert Einstein, Abraham Lincoln, or Ludwig van Beethoven. 

To Prepare: Students will need a computer that has the M3D software on it. We recommend one printer per every 2-5 students. The Micro or Micro+ 3D printer will need to be plugged into both the wall and the computer. Each printer will need to have a 250ft spool of PLA feeding into the external port. A spool holder is also recommended. 

If you need assistance with any of the above please see our guides at support.printm3d.com. 

Lesson Plan: 

1. Students will go online to download one of three models. If desired, you can have the files already ready to go for them. 

You can find the models of each of the busts here:   
Einstein - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:966908  
Lincoln - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:326000  
Beethoven - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:191218

2. Students will open the M3D Software on a computer, and upload the model. Once uploaded, they will scale the model to the desired size, and click print. 

3. After the model has completed printing, carefully remove it from the print bed. Now, it is ready to paint!

4. Studentâ€™s should paint their bust in a realistic way, carefully painting the details of the hair, face, and clothes.
