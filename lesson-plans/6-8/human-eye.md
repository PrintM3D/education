# Human Eye

Subject Area: Science

Learning Objectives: Students will learn about the anatomy of a human eye.   
   
Materials Needed: One computer, one Micro or Micro+ 3D printer, and one 250ft 3D Ink filament spool \(PLA or ABS-R3 recommended\) per 2-5 students. 

Brief Description: Students will print and examine a model of a human eye to learn about its anatomy. 

To Prepare: Students will need a computer that has the M3D software on it. We recommend one printer per every 2-5 students. The Micro or Micro+ 3D printer will need to be plugged into both the wall and the computer. Each printer will need to have a 250ft spool feeding into the external port. A spool holder is also recommended. 

If you need assistance with any of the above please see our guides at support.printm3d.com. 

Lesson Plan: 

1. Students will go online to https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1193457 and download the models. They can either download the complete model, or download it in sections and put it together. 

2. Upload the models to M3D software and print them. 

3. Once all the models have finished printing, students can use them to examine and identify the different components of a human eye.
