# Design A Puzzle

Subject Area: Engineering, Art

Learning Objectives: Students will use CAD to design a 2D or 3D puzzle.   
   
Materials Needed: One computer, CAD software, one Micro or Micro+ 3D printer, and one 250ft 3D Ink filament spool \(PLA or ABS-R3 recommended\) per 2-5 students. 

Brief Description: Students will use CAD to design a 2D or 3D puzzle, print it out, assemble it, and then they can decorate their puzzle if they wish. 

To Prepare: Students will need a computer that has the M3D software on it. We recommend one printer per every 2-5 students. The Micro or Micro+ 3D printer will need to be plugged into both the wall and the computer. Each printer will need to have a 250ft spool feeding into the external port. A spool holder is also recommended. 

If you need assistance with any of the above please see our guides at support.printm3d.com. 

Lesson Plan: 

1. Students will use CAD to design either a 2D or a 3D puzzle and export the file as an .stl or .obj file. 

2. Students will upload the models to M3D software and click print their puzzle. 

3. Students should assemble their puzzles to make sure they fit together well. Then, if theyâ€™d like they can decorate their puzzles.
