# Rocket

Subject Area: Science, Technology

Learning Objectives: Students will learn principles of CAD \(optional\) and rocket science.   
   
Materials Needed: One computer, CAD software \(optional\), one Micro or Micro+ 3D printer, and one 250ft 3D Ink filament spool \(ABS-R recommended\) per 2-5 students, rocket launch kits with stands,  parachutes, sandpaper, super glue, rubber bands, model A rocket engines, wadding paper, and rocket igniters.  

Brief Description: Students will use CAD to design a 3D printable rocket \(optional\), print and stuff the rocket, and then finally launch their rockets. 

To Prepare: Students will need a computer that has the M3D software on it. We recommend one printer per every 2-5 students. The Micro or Micro+ 3D printer will need to be plugged into both the wall and the computer. Each printer will need to have a 250ft spool feeding into the external port. A spool holder is also recommended. 

If you need assistance with any of the above please see our guides at support.printm3d.com. 

Lesson Plan: 

1. Divide students into small groups of 2-5 students.   
2. Ask the students to design a 3d printable rocket in CAD software. Their design should be a size A rocket and have 3 parts: A top, middle, and bottom \(This may take more than one class\).  Alternatively, if you want to skip the CAD part of this lesson, students could download a rocket model \(size A recommended\) from thingiverse, such as this one: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:8817.   
3. Teams should 3D print their rockets.   
4. Next, assemble the rockets. Students will need to glue together the middle and bottom pieces of their rockets and sand the nose cone so it fits snugly but can come off. Attach the parachute to the nose cone and the nose cone to the body of the rocket via rubber band.   
5. Next, stuff the rockets with an igniter and 1-2 pieces of wadding paper.   
6. Place the rockets on stands, make sure students are standing at least 15 feet away, and launch the rockets!  
7. If any break, you can 3D print a new one!
