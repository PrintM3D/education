# Human Body

Subject Area: Science

Learning Objectives: Students will learn about the anatomy of a human skeleton.   
   
Materials Needed: One computer, one Micro or Micro+ 3D printer, and one 250ft 3D Ink filament spool \(PLA or ABS-R3 recommended\) per 2-5 students. 

Brief Description: Students will print and assemble a human skeleton to learn about its anatomy. 

To Prepare: Students will need a computer that has the M3D software on it. We recommend one printer per every 2-5 students. The Micro or Micro+ 3D printer will need to be plugged into both the wall and the computer. Each printer will need to have a 250ft spool feeding into the external port. A spool holder is also recommended. 

If you need assistance with any of the above please see our guides at support.printm3d.com. 

Lesson Plan: 

1. Students will go online to https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1543880 and download the 16 models. 

2. Upload the models to M3D software, and print them. Some of the models will need to be printed with supports, such as the upper torso. If you printed a model with supports, you will need to remove the support material from the print when it has finished printing. 

3. Once all the models have finished printing, students can assemble their skeleton models. 

4. After the skeletons are assembled, students should use them to identify the bones in the human body.
