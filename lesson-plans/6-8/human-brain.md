# Human Brain

Subject Area: Science

Learning Objectives: Students will identify the different lobes of the brain.   
   
Materials Needed: One computer, one Micro or Micro+ 3D printer, and one 250ft 3D Ink filament spool \(PLA or ABS-R3 recommended\) per 2-5 students. 

Brief Description: Students will print and assemble a human skeleton to learn about its anatomy. 

To Prepare: Students will need a computer that has the M3D software on it. We recommend one printer per every 2-5 students. The Micro or Micro+ 3D printer will need to be plugged into both the wall and the computer. Each printer will need to have a 250ft spool feeding into the external port. A spool holder is also recommended. 

If you need assistance with any of the above please see our guides at support.printm3d.com. 

Lesson Plan: 

1. Students will go online to https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:632569 and download the 19 models. 

2. Upload the models to M3D software and print them one by one

3. Once all the models have finished printing, students will take the different pieces and figure out how they fit together, like a puzzle. 

4. When fully assembled, each student or small group will have two cross-sections of a brain. 

5. Students should glue them down to a posterboard and then label the different lobes and components: Frontal lobe, temporal lobe, occipital lobe, brain stem, cerebellum, right hemisphere, left hemisphere, and corpus callosum.
