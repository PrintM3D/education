# Postulates

Subject Area: Math

Learning Objectives: Students will learn about postulates.  
   
Materials Needed: One computer, one Micro or Micro+ 3D printer, and one 250ft 3D Ink filament spool \(PLA or ABS-R3 recommended\) per 2-5 students. 

Brief Description: Students will print out postulates to have a physical, tactile tool while learning about postulates. 

To Prepare: Students will need a computer that has the M3D software on it. We recommend one printer per every 2-5 students. The Micro or Micro+ 3D printer will need to be plugged into both the wall and the computer. Each printer will need to have a 250ft spool feeding into the external port. A spool holder is also recommended. 

If you need assistance with any of the above please see our guides at support.printm3d.com. 

Lesson Plan: 

1. Students will go online to: https://support.printm3d.com/145216-3D-Models and download the postulate models

2. Students will open the M3D Software on a computer, upload one of the models, and click print.

3. Repeat with the other models. 

4. Students now have a visual representation of the postulates that they can use while learning about them.
